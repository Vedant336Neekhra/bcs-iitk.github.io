The goal of the workshop was to introduce the basics of different technical skills needed for studying brain science and to reverse engineer human brain/intelligence to create more general and intelligent AI's. It covered a range of topics, including:
* Basic Machine Learning
* Computational Modeling
* Psychophysics, Data Analysis and Experiment Design

The lectures and workshop materials were a combination of links to different online resources plus some additional materials created by [Brain and Cognitive Society, IIT Kanpur](https://bcs-iitk.github.io/). Assignments were created by [Brain and Cognitive Society, IIT Kanpur](https://bcs-iitk.github.io/).
